# Application of Document Chunking Strategies in RAG

## Background Knowledge

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge approach in natural language processing that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models. This hybrid technique enhances the ability of language models to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses by retrieving pertinent documents or information chunks from a large corpus before generating a response.

## Concept of RAG

RAG integrates two key components:
- **Retriever:** Searches a large database or knowledge base to find relevant documents or passages based on a query.
- **Generator:** Uses the retrieved documents as context to generate a coherent and informative response.

By leveraging external knowledge through retrieval, RAG models overcome the limitations of static training data and improve the quality of generated content.

## Importance of Document Chunking in RAG

Document chunking involves splitting large documents into smaller, manageable pieces or "chunks." This process is critical in RAG systems for several reasons:
- **Efficiency:** Smaller chunks allow faster retrieval and reduce computational overhead.
- **Relevance:** Fine-grained chunks enable more precise matching between queries and relevant information.
- **Contextual Quality:** Proper chunking ensures that the generator receives coherent and contextually rich information, improving response quality.

Different chunking strategies can significantly impact the performance of RAG models, making it essential to explore and optimize these methods.

## Project Description

This project investigates various document chunking strategies applied within a RAG system built using FAISS for vector search, RocksDB for key-value storage, Hugging Face Transformers for embedding generation, OpenAI API for advanced language generation, and Streamlit for interactive visualization and experimentation. The focus is on understanding how these strategies influence retrieval efficiency, generation quality, and resource utilization in a practical pipeline.

## Project Tasks

1. **Literature Review**
   - Study existing document chunking techniques.
   - Understand current RAG architectures and their reliance on chunking.
2. **Implementation of Chunking Strategies**
   - **Contextual Retrieval:** Chunking based on semantic context boundaries to preserve meaning.
   - **Late Chunking:** Retrieving larger documents first, then chunking post-retrieval to refine relevance.
   - **Meta-Chunking:** Combining multiple chunking approaches leveraging metadata and content structure.
   - Integrate these methods into the RAG pipeline.
3. **Experimentation and Evaluation**
   - Measure retrieval accuracy and generation quality across strategies.
   - Analyze time and memory trade-offs with detailed performance graphs.
4. **Analysis and Reporting**
   - Identify optimal chunking strategies balancing accuracy and efficiency.
   - Document practical recommendations for production deployment.

## Comparison and Evaluation

Evaluation focuses on retrieval accuracy, generation coherence, and the trade-offs between time and memory consumption. Experiments include benchmarking retrieval precision and recall, assessing generation relevance, and profiling system performance with time and memory usage graphs to inform scalable deployment decisions.

## Expected Outcomes

- Practical insights into the strengths and limitations of different chunking strategies within RAG pipelines.
- Clear understanding of trade-offs between retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and resource efficiency.
- Actionable recommendations for implementing chunking methods in production environments using modern NLP and database technologies.
- Enhanced ability to design scalable, efficient RAG systems informed by empirical performance data.
